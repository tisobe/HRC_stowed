<h2>How to Create a Background Map for an Observation</h2>

<h4><i>T. Isobe and M. Juda</i></h4>

<p>
Although <a href="http://asc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/expmap_hrci/">
Compute an HRC-I Exposure Map and Build Fluxed Image</a> explains how
to a HRC-I fluxed map in detail,  we explain in this note how to
incorporate a stowed background map to create a better fluxed
map. The "ring" artifacts mentioned in the flux map are due
to applying a HRMA vignetting correction to the particle
background. Subtracting an estimate for the particle background
from the observation before exposure correcting should eliminate
these artifacts.  If you like to know more about HRC stowed backgrounds, please go to 
<a href = "./hrc_stowed_position_study.html">High Resolution Camera Stowed Background Study</a>.
</p>


<p>
The following table shows the yearly cumulative HRC-I stowed level 1
event file links and their dead time corrected total yearly exposure time. 
</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" style='margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;'>

            <th>Year</th>

            <th>Corrected Exposure Time (sec)</th>
            <th>Total Event Numbers</th>
        </tr>

#TABLE#

</tbody>
</table>


<p>
The HRC-I background event files are also available for download as part of <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/download/caldb.html">CALDB 4.7.3</a>, released on 31 May 2016.
(see also <a href='http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/hrci_bg_events/'>CIAO The HRC-I Background Event Files</a> Page.)
</p>

<p>
Download the event file of the year in which your observation is
done. If the observation is done during the current year, you
may want to combine the current year and the previous year to have
a sufficient stowed observation time. Since the thread
<a href="http://asc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/expmap_hrci/"> 
Compute an HRC-I Exposure Map and Build Fluxed Image</a>  uses
OBSID = 144, observed in year 2000, we use the year 2000 stowed
background data in the example below. 
</p>


<p>
First, we perform status-bit filtering on the stowed background
data.This filtering will remove the events that standard
processing would have removeded as likely "background"
events in generating the primary (level 2) event list.
</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
unix% dmcopy "hrc_i_115_2000_evt1.fits[status=xxxxxx00xxxx0xxx00000000x0000000]" \ 
      outfile=hrc_i_115_2000_evt2.fits
</pre>
</blockquote>
<br />

<p>
If a different status-bit mask was used, the corresponding change should be made here as well.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Since the stowed event file does not have correct sky coordinates, we need to
add them; we will do this using the CIAO tool "reproject_events". For HRC
event-lists a time column is required and the times need to lie within the
observation's time-interval. We use the CIAO tool 
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/dmtcalc.html">dmtcalc</a>
to modify the background file's event-times to match those in the GTI of the observation.
</p>

<p>
Using the observation's event list, hrcf00144N004_evt2.fits, to get the times:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
unix% dmstat "hrcf00144N004_evt2.fits[cols time]"
time[s]
    min:        84154932.677          @:        1 
    max:        84185127.061          @:        854440 
   mean:        84169382.053 
  sigma:        9148.9938848 
    sum:        7.1917686801e+13 
   good:        854440 
   null:        0 
</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>
we can then use 
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/dmtcalc.html">dmtcalc</a>
modify the stowed background event times:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
unix% dmtcalc infile=hrc_i_115_2000_evt2.fits outfile=hrc_i_115_2000_time_corrected_evt2.fits \
      expression="time=30194*#trand+84154933"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
where 	
</p>
<ul class='medium'>
<li>time:       time value in data column</li>
<li>30194:      the difference between the starting and stopping time of the observation</li>
<li>#trad:      random number generator which uses a system clock time as a seed</li>
<li>84154933:   the starting time of the observation </li>
</ul>

<p>
Now, using <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/reproject_events.html">reproject_events</a> and the aspect file of 
obsid 144, we compute the sky coordinates matched to chip coordinates of the stowed background file.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
unix% reproject_events infile="hrc_i_115_2000_time_corrected_evt2.fits" \
      outfile=hrc_i_115_2000_bkg.fits aspect=pcadf084154631N004_asol1.fits \
      match=hrcf00144N004_evt2.fits random=0 clobber=yes
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Since <a href="http://asc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/expmap_hrci/">"HRC-I
Exposure Map and Fluxed Image"</a> is using the binning of 32x32, we use the same factor. 
</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
unix% dmcopy "hrc_i_115_2000_bkg.fits[bin x=::32, y=::32]" outfile=hrc_i_115_2000_bkg_img.fits
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Subtract this background image from the observation image, using a
suitable weight to account for the difference in exposure times.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
unix% dmimgcalc 144_img32.fits hrc_i_115_2000_bkg_img.fits 144_img32_bkg_sub.fits \ 
      sub weight=1 weight2=0.3202
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
where 0.3202 is <b><i>(observation exposure time)/(background exposure time)</i></b>= 30192/94287.
The background subtracted image is shown below. From this image, all negative value pixels were droped.
</p>

<p>
On this image, we apply the exposure map normalization, following the example shown in
<a href="http://asc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/expmap_hrci/">HRC-I Exposure Map and Fluxed Image</a>
page. 
</p>

<p>
The resulting fluxed image is shown below (the right side plot). As before, all negative value 
pixels were droped from the map.

</p>

<p>
The images below are same as above, but the upper threshold is set to 3.0e-5 (cnt/pix/sec) 
to show the concentric rings on the original data analysis (left). The background subrtracted
image (right) does not show these rings.

</p>
<br /><br />

<p>
Figure 6 is the plot of  the numbers of events for counts/pixel/sec after the background adjusted.
About a half of the events are in the negative side. This is statistically expected.
</p>

<p>
The background file binned at 32x32 probably has a significant number of counts in each image 
cell (mean ~2e-7cnt/pix/sec). The observation when binned at the same factor may have many image cells 
with zero events, some with one and a few with two or more.
The cells with zero will give negative values in the difference map 
but the cells with ones or more give positive values and on average, away from 
sources we can expect the difference to be zero or slightly larger due to an 
additional sky- or low-energy-proton- background component in the observation.
